2. **Emphasize practical understanding**: Discuss workflows, not just features
3. **Connect to business value**: Talk about cost savings, risk reduction, compliance
4. **Acknowledge limitations**: Shows realistic understanding
5. **Discuss integration**: How Purview connects with other Microsoft security tools

Good luck with your interview! Focus on understanding the **why** behind features, not just the **what**. The role likely requires someone who can explain complex compliance concepts to non-technical stakeholders.
